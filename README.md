# Woo Affiliate

A comprehensive affiliate marketing solution for WooCommerce stores that enables customers to earn commissions by referring new customers to your store.

## Description

Woo Affiliate transforms your customers into brand advocates by allowing them to earn commissions when they refer new customers to your store. The plugin creates a win-win situation: existing customers earn money through commissions, new customers receive discounts on their purchases, and store owners increase their sales through word-of-mouth marketing.

The plugin seamlessly integrates with WooCommerce and provides an intuitive interface for both administrators and affiliate users. Set global or category-specific commission and discount rates, track referrals with cookies, and manage commission withdrawals all from within your WordPress dashboard.

## How It Works
